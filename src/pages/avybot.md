Personal SMS avalanche forecast service.

## How it works

I text a zone keyword (like `baker` or `stevens`) and forecast type to my AvyBot number and receive the current avalanche danger forecast from the Northwest Avalanche Center (NWAC) in reply.

## Example

**Request:** `a baker`

**Response:**
```
West Slopes North — Feb 24
Above: Consid | Near: Consid | Below: Mod

Storm Slab: Likely, D1.5-2.5
All aspects, all elevs

Wet Loose: Likely, D1-2
All aspects, all elevs

The snow has ended, but this may not be our normal post storm powder day. Unstable snow could linger longer than normal on some slopes, and natural avalanches may run if the sun comes out. Ease into the terrain slowly, using plenty of small and low consequence slopes to gain information.
```
