                    <a href="https://www.ferryfriend.com/">FerryFriend</a>,
                    currently in version 3.0, is the premier schedule app for
                    the Washington State Ferries, with an average App Store
                    rating of 5.0 and over 2000 reviews. However, the app,
                    originally written in Swift, has to this point only been
                    available for iOS. As usage grew, many Android users
                    expressed their desire to see the app come to that platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had the great opportunity to join the FerryFriend team for
                    the development of an Android version of the app, originally
                    conceived to be a standalone version alongside the existing
                    iOS app (more on that later). Based on my previous
                    experience with React Native, we decided it would be the
                    best choice of framework to build the new version. The goal
                    throughout the project was to emulate the functionality and
                    aesthetic of the existing app, which provided a desing
                    schematic to start from.

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:-ml-4">Integrating with the WSF API</h3>
                <p>
                    Washington State (WSDOT) provides a number of{" "}
                    <a
                        href="https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/api/schedule/documentation/"
                    >
                        useful APIs
                    </a>{" "}
                    for public access to ferry information. These form the backbone
                    of the data used by FerryFriend to show schedules, alerts, fares,
                    and vessel positions. Additionally, FerryFriend has its own public
                    API which provides sailing delays (using its own prediction model),
                    as well as reservation information and ticket lookups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges of the WSDOT API is that there are
                    inconsistencies and proprietary data formats between the
                    different routes. To handle these inconsistencies, we chose
                    to implement a &quot;Provider&quot; model in order to
                    preprocess all incoming WSF data into a common format used
                    throughout the app. This model consists of 5 different WSF
                    Api providers which retrieve data from the APIs using Axios.
                    The results are stored in a local cache to reduce the total
                    number of network requests, as well as aid in offline data
                    storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A &quot;Data Manager&quot; then consumes these providers,
                    packaging different data sources together for use in
                    individual components, which consume the data via a global
                    context reference. A subscriber model is used to continually
                    check for schedule and delay updates while the app is
                    focused, a particularly important feature for the
                    time-sensitive data they represent. For example, the route
                    schedule screen below consumes data from the WSF schedule
                    provider (scheduled sailing times), WSF Reservation details
                    provider (reservable space availability), WSF terminal info
                    provider (drive-up spaces), FerryFriend predictions provider
                    (delay predictions).

            <Section title="FerryFriend Native becomes FerryFriend 4.0">
                <p>
                    As the main functionality of the app began to come together,
                    we gradually realized that the increase in maintainability,
                    and ability of one code-base to support two separate native
                    versions of the app would ultimately make the React Native
                    version of the app a logical choice to become the new
                    primary codebase for FerryFriend, necessitating a new major
                    version of the iOS app as well. With this in mind, we began
                    to implement several completely new features alongside the
                    existing features from FerryFriend 3.0.

                    Improvements in user interface design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    One of the benefits of having an existing user base was the
                    availability of plenty of user feedback on existing designs.
                    Some of this feedback led to redesigns of user interaction
                    elements. First up was the tab navigation interface:
                </p>
                <div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
                    <div class="">
                        <p>Before:</p>
                        <Image src={ffOldMenu} alt="Old menu" />
                        <p class="text-sm">
                            The original menu was functional, but dense user
                            controls could be confusing and difficult to target.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="">

                        <Image src={ffMenu} alt="New menu" />
                        <p class="text-sm">
                            Using space freed up by the tab navigator, we were
                            able to redesign the route top bar to increase
                            legibility and simplify user interaction.{" "}
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="">
                        <Image src={ffTab} alt="tab navigator" />
                        <p class="text-sm">
                            The tab navigator was moved from the upper margin of
                            the route screen to the bottom, improving access
                            with one hand.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Two of the most popular features on FerryFriend are the
                    ferry line screen, and the vessel watch screen. We took care
                    to improve the usability of these screens without
                    drastically changing their layout.
                </p>

                <div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">

                        <p class="text-sm">
                            On the cameras screen, we improved touch targets on
                            the carousel viewer and increased the legibility of
                            the map.

                        <p class="text-sm">
                            On the vessel view screen, we added additional
                            vessel details to the vessel modal, with important
                            details like vehicle and passenger capacity.

                <h3 class="text-xl sm:-ml-4">Dark Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    In response to another user request, we spent a good amount
                    of time implementing a theming engine and thinking carefully
                    about how to implement a dark mode well. Users are able to
                    toggle this mode manually, or follow the system settings. I
                    am quite happy with how this turned out.

                    Favorite routes are a key feature for regular ferry users,

                    for favorite routes directly on the home screen. Using the
                    colors from route predictions to indicate severity of delay,
                    we added badges to the existing favorite route component for

                    This feature allows regular ferry riders to scan a
                    Washington State Ferry ticket with the app, which then
                    checks the WSF ticket API for remaining uses and expiry

                    share tickets between users. With an implementation on
                    Ferryfriend.com, we were able to use the link query string
                    parameters to render a web based visualization of the same
                    ticket, allowing anyone to utilize a shared FerryFriend
                    ticket, even if they don&apos;t have the app installed on
                    their phone.{" "}

                    This was a project of “firsts” for me: my first time working
                    on a full-scale application, and my first project with a
                    “real” user base. I am hugely grateful for the team at
                    FerryFriend and the many hours of mentorship they provided
                    over the course of this project, as well as their
                    encouragement to take on new features and domains outside of
                    my comfort zone. I am proud of what I helped make, and am
                    looking forward to seeing what happens with the app in the
                    future!
