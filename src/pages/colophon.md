This site has been a fun place for me to experiment with tools and technologies over the last few years. Currently, it's built using:

    [Astro](https://astro.build/) for static generation and bundling.

    [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

    [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for markdown support.

    [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for integration and deployment.

    [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hassle-free hosting.
